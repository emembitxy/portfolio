           			 A small gallery of recent projects chosen by me.These are some of
           			 the works i've done so far during my training.<br />Interested in
            		seeing some? Visit <a href="#mywork">my work</a> page

         		 <p>
           			 normally i love a good work space to inspire me do a great job
           		 	because when i'm <br />relaxed and comfortable it makes it easier
           			 for me to think and be able to make researches. Although i've not
           			 made so many researches as you may expect because i called myself a
            		researcher,i could still say i'm aspiring to be a researcher.

         	 <p>
           		 Aspiring to be a web developer isn't bad at all because it's been
            	really interesting<br />
            	and maybe difficult at the same time cause i'm still trying to adapt
            	in this area. During my course of training i've been able to learn
            	and use HTML tags and elements and used some attributes. Also i've
            	learnt some basis in css even if the<br />
           		 journey has been confusing and i believe i could do better.
